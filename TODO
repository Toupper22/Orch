Let's think about this integration deployments again. 

- Start with folders, maybe one integraton will be in folder src/<integration name>
- Subfolder atleast function app and logicapps
- In functionApp folder there is one function app with multiple functions. net8 isolated running on linux app service plan
- More problematic is logicapps folder. There will be 1-N amount of logic apps that needs to be deployed in order. Somekind of config under intgegration? Only consumption logic apps
- Deployment will work with reusable bicep modules
- In actions file when starting deployment you should be able to select what do deploy. (Already done)

Can you create an example integration and it's deployments. Let's forget those old ones for a while.
It should have 1 function app and then three logic apps. First is scheduler that will start every 15 minutes and check for new files in container /sepa on archivce storage account
If new files are found the starter will send them to handler that calls process logic app where is call to function app to make a simple transformation. For the sake of demo it can only write like transformed in the end of the payload. Process logic app will send result of the transformation (successful/fail) back to handler and in handler the errors are parsed and if error is found the return error to starter and fail the run
