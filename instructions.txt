Projects are integration projects made in Azure mainly connecting to Dynamics 365 Finance and operations. Components mainly used are logic apps, function apps, service bus, keyvaults, storage accounts, managed identities and so on. What would be the best practises 

Deployments are made using reusable bicep modules and github actions. Every integration should have it's own github action file where you can select branch, tier (dev, test, uat or prod). We will be using environemt secrets to connect to Azure. Let's say that every GH env should have it's own secret called AZURE_CREDENTAILS and based on action selection correct is used

First we need create a deployable infra and "common" resource group, that will hold components shared with integrations wich are in their own resource groups. Shared components belonging to infra are at least keyvault, app service plan, generic storage account, managed id shared with resources to simplify access grants. 

First we need to have a simple settings file that developer will fill. There should be atleat customer name. Then we need to deploy infra as iac following well architecture framework
